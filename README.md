# Rust Boy
-----------

This is project **Rust Boy**, which is my thesis for the master's degree.

**Rust Boy** is a Nintendo Game Boy emulator, which will be cycle-accurate in theory. This repository will serve as a source backup and version contolling for the project, and when the time comes, the writing part of the essay will be uploaded here - as is progresses - too.

*The project's deadline is somewhere in February, 2018.*

In the initial commit, I already made the project structure (which may be change in the future - I'm not sure yet) and some opcodes. On the bottom of this page there is a TODO part, which indicates the current tasks and/or problems, future updates.

## Current TODOs

- [x] Initial commit.
- [ ] Combine the emulator with the debugger/tester I wrote for debugging the already implemented instructions.
- [ ] Test the already written instructions.
- [ ] Code cleaning.
